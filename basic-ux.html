                    It was an interesting approach and gave good dynamics to the group.
                    <br><br>We also learned how to use Sprint as an idea creation tool. It was a very insightful way to approach problem solving and it is definitely something I want to try and use in the future.
                    <br><br>During the sprint we were able to take a broad idea and narrow it down to something concrete and ended up with a nice and polished product.</p>

                    <br><br>It came as a surprise and a challenge as we created the XD prototype without concern for how to code it.
                    <br><br>However, it was an excellent opportunity to test how far my skills coding-wise had come. I wanted to create all the features we had included in the prototype and even though some of them posed a challenge I am happy with the outcome. I feel the web prototype and the XD prototype are close to identical, which was my goal.

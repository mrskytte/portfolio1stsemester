                <p class="task-p">The first project of this theme I had to create a story of my own choice. I used the narrative curve in order to make sure the story had proper development.
                    <br><br>I also made use of a style tile and combining these two component I was able to create a compelling and coherent story.
                    <br><br>I had a great experience using illustrator for this submission and felt my skill level improve.</p>

                <p class="task-p">With the final submission of the theme we got the first taste of group work and to my group was fantastic. Everybody was on the same page from day one and that made it possible for us to create an amazing product.
                    <br><br>I was in charge for most of the coding and tried to challenge myself. I created an astroid evasion game with &lt;canvas&gt; and it was a blast. I was able to make it work just the way I wanted it.
                    <br><br>Being in a group also taught me the importance of structuring my code. I was working hard to organise the code in the document but also with GitHub in order for my group to understand the complex code.

                <p class="task-p">While we worked on our interactive poster we also had to document our work process as well as our challenges.
                    <br><br>One major problem we saw when we did our user testing was that users were confused what the story was and didn’t find it coherent.
                    <br><br>We fixed that by adding text bubbles and that really showed us the importance of user testing.
